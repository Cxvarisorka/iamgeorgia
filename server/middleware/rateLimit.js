 * promises are left rejected *permanently*, so every later increment fails
 * against a Redis that came back minutes ago. Re-running init on the client's
 * `ready` event is what makes recovery real. Everything else delegates to the
 * store untouched — calls are forwarded rather than inherited so `this` stays
 * the RedisStore, which is the object whose script hashes they read.
 *
 * The second is what happens to a request whose store call fails. That is
 * handled by `passOnStoreError` in `base` below, not here: an earlier version
 * of this file tried to count in memory instead, and counting a request in one
 * store while the library believed it was talking to another produced wrong
 * totals the moment Redis returned. The library's own option is the one that
 * knows how the middleware accounts for a failed increment.
