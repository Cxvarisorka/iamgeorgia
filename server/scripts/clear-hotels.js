 * Clears the hotel catalogue completely — bookings, holds, hotels and every
 * hotel and room image, database rows and stored bytes both.
 *
 *   node scripts/clear-hotels.js
 *
 * Development tooling only: it walks straight past every "a hotel is never
 * deleted" rule in the services, which is exactly why it lives here and not
 * behind an endpoint. Reference data (amenities, bed types, meal plans, the
 * policy templates) and the destination tree survive, so `seed-reference.js`
 * does not need to run again and `seed-catalogue.js` can rebuild the catalogue
 * immediately afterwards.
