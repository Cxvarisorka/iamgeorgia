/**
 * Availability from our own tables.
 *
 * The one provider that exists today. Everything below is deliberately behind
 * the same interface an external channel manager will implement, so adding one
 * later is a new file rather than a change to search or booking.
 *
 * The search query is raw SQL, not Prisma. It is a windowed aggregate over a
 * date range with a HAVING clause, and expressing it through the fluent API
 * would mean several round trips and a lot of work in JavaScript that Postgres
 * does better.
 */

/**
 * Candidate offers: every rate plan that can actually be sold for these dates.
 *
 * The load-bearing clause is `HAVING count(*) = nights`. A rate plan only
 * survives if **every** night has both a price and stock — so a stay from the
 * 20th to the 23rd where the 22nd is sold out returns nothing at all, rather
 * than an offer that fails at checkout.
 *
 * Restrictions that close a single night are enforced by the joins rather than
 * by a filter: excluding the row drops the count below `nights` and the whole
 * offer falls out. Restrictions about the stay as a whole — minimum stay,
 * advance booking, closed to arrival or departure — are NOT EXISTS clauses,
 * because they are properties of the booking rather than of a night.
 *
 * The kosher filters are two clauses and one LEFT JOIN, and that is all they
 * needed to be: every *facility* an observant traveller searches for — a kosher
 * restaurant, a Shabbat elevator, a synagogue, a mikveh — is an amenity, so it
 * goes through the amenity block below and adds nothing here.
