 * Bookings.

 *
 *   1. **Nothing the client sends about money is believed.** The request carries
 *      identifiers, dates, guests and a token. Availability, occupancy, nightly
 *      rates, taxes and the final amount are all recomputed here, and a price
 *      that has moved is a 409 rather than a silent charge.
 *
 *   2. **The booking is a snapshot.** Hotel name, room name, board, cancellation
 *      terms and every night's price are frozen onto it. The foreign keys stay
 *      for reporting; nothing that a guest was promised is ever re-read from a
 *      record the hotel can edit afterwards.
