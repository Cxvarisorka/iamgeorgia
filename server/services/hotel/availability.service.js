/**
 * Claiming inventory.
 *
 * This is the file the whole module is built around, and it rests on one idea:
 * **never read availability and then write it.** A single conditional UPDATE
 * whose WHERE clause *is* the availability check is what makes overbooking
 * impossible.
 *
 *   UPDATE room_inventory SET held_units = held_units + :qty
 *    WHERE ... AND total - blocked - booked - held >= :qty
 *
 * Under READ COMMITTED, an UPDATE that meets a row locked by a concurrent
 * transaction blocks, and then **re-evaluates its WHERE clause against the
 * newly committed row**. The loser of a race therefore finds no availability,
 * matches zero rows, and rolls back. No SELECT FOR UPDATE, no SERIALIZABLE, no
 * retry loop — and the same claim-then-count-rows shape the invitation flow in
 * `partner.service.js` already uses.
 *
 * SERIALIZABLE would also be correct, but it turns every booking into a
 * candidate for a 40001 serialization failure, which means a retry loop in
 * every caller and worse throughput. Row locks give the same guarantee for
 * free.
 *
 * Beneath all of it, `room_inventory_no_oversell` is a CHECK constraint: even a
 * future writer that bypasses this file entirely raises 23514 and rolls back,
 * which `middleware/errors.js` renders as a 409.
