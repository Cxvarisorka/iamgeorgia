 * Cancellation: turning policy into money.

 * Pure by design — plain data in, plain data out, no Prisma and no `req`. That
 * is what lets every boundary case be tested exhaustively, and these are
 * boundaries that decide refunds.
 *
 * The important idea is that a booking never re-reads its hotel's policy. At
 * confirmation the rules are resolved into a **schedule of absolute instants**
 * and frozen onto the booking. Cancelling is then a lookup in that schedule,
 * so a hotel that tightens its terms in March cannot retroactively change what
 * a guest who booked in January is owed.
