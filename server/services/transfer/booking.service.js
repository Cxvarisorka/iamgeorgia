/**
 * Confirming, reading, amending and cancelling a transfer.

 * hard parts are identical and solving them twice differently would guarantee
 * the two disagreed:
 *
 *   * the idempotency replay is answered **before** anything else happens;
 *   * the re-quote runs **outside** the transaction, which reads a lot;
 *   * a fare that moved is a 409 the traveller re-confirms, never absorbed;
 *   * the cancellation schedule is frozen at confirmation and is the only
 *     thing a cancellation ever reads;
 *   * nothing slow happens inside the transaction — no email, no HTTP.
 *
 * What is different is what is *not* here: no inventory claim, because a
 * transfer has none. The transaction writes the booking and its legs and that
 * is all, which makes it shorter than the hotel one rather than more clever.
