/**
 * Candidate departures: every option that can actually be sold on a date.
 *
 * The same two-stage split as hotel search, and for the same reason. Dated
 * search used to hydrate the whole catalogue — five hundred tours with their
 * galleries and translations, every option with every season and every tier —
 * price all of it, and then show twenty-four cards. This query does the
 * choosing instead: it touches only the tables that decide whether something
 * is sellable, returns ids and a total, and lets the caller hydrate the page
 * and nothing else.
 *
 * It replaced a `pageSize: 500` read that also silently truncated the
 * catalogue: an eight-hundredth tour could not be found by a dated search at
 * all, whatever its price.
 *
 * Everything here mirrors a rule that `pricing.service.js` states in
 * JavaScript, because both have to agree on which departures exist and what
 * they cost:
 *
 *   * the party is categorised against *this tour's* own age bands, so the
 *     same child is a child on one tour and an adult on another;
 *   * the season is the highest-priority active sheet covering the date whose
 *     weekday mask matches, most recent first among equals — `resolveSeason`;
 *   * the tier is the highest `min_pax` the party still reaches — `resolveTier`;
 *   * the total is the sell price, rounded per line then multiplied, so it is
 *     the same integer `quoteTour` arrives at rather than an approximation the
 *     page order would have to be forgiven for.
 *
 * What it deliberately does *not* decide is notice, horizon and past-date —
 * those depend on the current instant rather than on stored data, and the
 * caller applies them to these rows before paginating. They are cheap on ids.
