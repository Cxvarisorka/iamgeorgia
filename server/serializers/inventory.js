/**
 * Inventory, rate and quote responses.
 *
 * `availableUnits` is computed here and nowhere else. It is not a column, and
 * making it one would create a fifth number that can disagree with the four it
 * is derived from — the single failure mode this table cannot afford.
 *
 * Anything on the supplier side of the margin — net rates, markup, margin — is
 * absent rather than null for a viewer without permission, so a client cannot
 * tell the difference between "no margin" and "you may not see the margin".
 *
 * Permission means admin *or the supplier that owns this hotel*: the net rate
 * is the supplier's own contracted cost, and hiding it from them would be
 * absurd. It stays invisible to everyone else, because a guest who can see the
 * net rate can see the margin.
