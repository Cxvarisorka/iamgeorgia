 *
 * One rule runs through all of it: **net figures and margin are staff-only, and
 * absent rather than null** for anyone else. A `netCents: null` in a payload
 * tells a reader there is a number they are not being shown, which is both
 * useless to them and an invitation. The field simply is not there.
 *
 * "Staff" for a transfer means an admin or the partner that owns the vehicle.
 * There is no per-property ownership to check the way there is for a hotel, so
 * this is simpler than `canViewNetRates` and deliberately not routed through
 * it — passing a vehicle to a function whose parameter is named `hotel` would
 * work and would be a lie.
