/**
 * Kosher responses.
 *
 * Built by listing what goes out, never by deleting what must not — the same
 * allow-list discipline as every other serializer here.
 *
 * The one rule that matters more than the rest: **`certified` is never taken
 * from a stored field**, because there is no stored field to take it from. It
 * comes out of `deriveKosher`, which needs a live, unexpired, property-scoped
 * certificate to say true. An admin ticking every kosher amenity on the list
 * produces a hotel with a long feature set and `certified: false`, which is the
 * honest answer.
 *
 * Three things are staff-only and *absent* rather than null for anyone else, so
 * a client cannot tell "no value" from "not permitted":
 *   * `source` / `sourceRef` — where this came from is commercial information.
 *   * `lockedAt` / `lockedBy` — an internal review marker.
 *   * `pendingSupplierData` — a supplier's disagreement with us.
