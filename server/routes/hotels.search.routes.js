/**
 * Dated search.
 *
 * Distinct from `/api/hotels`, which browses the catalogue. This answers "what
 * can I actually book, on these dates, for these people" and every result is a
 * real offer with a real total. Conflating the two is how a site advertises
 * rooms it cannot sell.
 *
 * `optionalAuthenticate` because a signed-in partner sees partner-only rates
 * and their own commission, while an anonymous visitor sees public rates at the
 * platform markup — the same endpoint, two answers, decided by the session
 * rather than by anything in the request.
