/**

 * Bakuriani" from catalogue content alone. It deliberately does not check
 * availability — that is the dated search endpoint, and conflating the two is
 * how a site ends up advertising rooms it cannot sell.
 *
 * `PUBLIC_STATUSES` is passed to the service rather than being expressible in
 * the query, so there is no combination of parameters that reaches a DRAFT.
 *
 * `optionalAuthenticate`, because "from" prices are viewer-relative: the
 * cached figure is a **net** rate and never leaves the building raw — it is
 * marked up here for whoever is asking, a partner at their commission and an
 * anonymous visitor at the platform default. Indicative either way; only the
 * dated search quotes something bookable.
