 * search result carries a fare into checkout, and the signature is what stops a
 * client editing it on the way. It is only half the protection and the smaller
 * half — **the backend re-quotes regardless**. The token prevents tampering,
 * revalidation catches genuine change, and a fare that has moved is a 409 the
 * traveller re-confirms rather than an error.
 *
 * Kept as its own module with its own secret rather than generalising the hotel
 * one. The payloads have nothing in common beyond being signed blobs, and a
 * shared key would mean rotating it for a compromised transfer quote
 * invalidated every hotel offer in flight.
