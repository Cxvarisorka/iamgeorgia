/**
 * The transactional outbox.
 *
 * A state change and the event describing it commit together, and a sweeper
 * turns the event into emails and in-app notifications afterwards. The
 * handler that writes the row never sends anything itself — which is what
 * keeps a dead mail server from turning a successful assignment into a 500,
 * and what lets a notification be retried without the assignment being made
 * twice.
 *
 * Topics are dotted and past-tense: `transfer.assignment.offered`.
