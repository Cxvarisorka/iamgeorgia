/**
 * Writes one row of the audit trail.
 *
 * The Prisma client is passed in rather than imported so a caller can hand over
 * a transaction handle: an approval and the record that it happened then commit
 * together, and there is no window in which a partner is approved with nothing
 * saying who did it.
 *
 * `actorEmail` is denormalized on purpose. The foreign key is SetNull, so
 * deleting an admin account nulls `actorUserId` — without the snapshot the
 * trail would forget who acted, which is the one thing it exists to remember.
