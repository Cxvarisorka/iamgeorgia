/**
 * Signed package offers.
 *
 * A package quote is a set of resolved slots, each carrying its own product
 * token (a hotel offer, a transfer quote, a tour offer) or, for a service, the
 * plain fields the service was priced from. The composite is signed as a
 * whole so that revalidation can recurse: read the package token, then read
 * and re-price each child exactly as the standalone checkouts do.
 *
 * Stateless, like the others. Nothing on the platform persists a quote and a
 * table of them would need a sweeper; the price of that is a token a few
 * kilobytes long, which is fine in a POST body.
