/**
 * Public, human-quotable identifiers drawn from Postgres sequences.

 * promise that. The sequence is not transactional: a rolled-back registration
 * burns its number rather than returning it. That is the right trade, because a
 * reused Partner ID or booking reference would be far worse than a gap.
 *
 * Every helper takes the client explicitly so it can be called with a
 * transaction handle and commit alongside the row it belongs to.
