# API surface

Every endpoint under `/api`. Written for the client: it says what to call, what
comes back, and which fields depend on who is asking.

**Conventions**

- Auth is an httpOnly session cookie (`iag_session`). Send `credentials: 'include'`.
- Errors are always `{ error: { message, details? } }`. `details` is a zod issue
  array for a 400, or a structured object for a domain conflict.
- **Money is integer minor units** and always travels with a `currency`.
- **Dates are `YYYY-MM-DD` strings**, never instants. Check-out is exclusive.
- Lists are `{ data, total, page, pageSize, totalPages }`.
- Fields marked **staff** are *absent*, not null, unless the viewer is an admin
  or the supplier that owns the hotel.

## Public catalogue

| Method | Path | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/destinations` | Whole tree, nested. `?locale&countryCode&featured` |
| GET | `/destinations/:slug` | Detail with `parent`, `children` |
| GET | `/hotels` | Browse, no dates. `?search&destinationSlug&destinationPath&propertyType&minStars&amenity&kosher&kosherCertified&featured&locale&page&pageSize` |
| GET | `/hotels/:slug` | Detail with `roomTypes[]`, `amenities[]`, `images[]`, `childPolicy` |
| GET | `/amenities` | Vocabulary. `?category&scope&locale` |

Only `ACTIVE` hotels are ever returned, whatever the query string says.

## Dated search

| Method | Path | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/search` | `?checkIn&checkOut&adults&childAges&rooms` + filters. Repeated params for arrays |
| GET | `/search/hotels/:slug` | Availability for one hotel, grouped by room |
| POST | `/search/offers/quote` | `{ token }` → re-priced offer, or 409 |

`/search` filters: `destinationSlug`, `destinationPath`, `countryCode`,
`propertyType`, `minStars`, `amenity` (repeatable), `mealPlan`, `refundableOnly`,
`kosher`, `kosherCertified`, `locale`, `page`, `pageSize`.

**Kosher filtering** is two parameters, and only two. Every kosher *facility* —
a kosher restaurant, a Shabbat elevator, a synagogue, a mikveh — is an amenity,
so it travels on `amenity` like any other:

| Parameter | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `kosher` | A **minimum** level of kosher service: `ON_REQUEST`, `KOSHER_FRIENDLY`, `PARTIAL`, `FULL`. `NONE` is rejected — it records "we asked, and the answer is no". |
| `kosherCertified` | A certificate that is verified **and** still valid today **and** covers the property (`PROPERTY` or `KITCHEN`, not `RESTAURANT` or `PASSOVER`). |
| `amenity=shabbatElevator` | A facility. Repeatable, and every one asked for must be present. |

`amenity` values are amenity **codes** and are case-sensitive: `shabbatElevator`,
not `shabbatelevator`.

A search that sends neither kosher parameter is unaffected by any of this.

**Search result card**

```jsonc
{
  "id": "...", "slug": "...", "name": "...", "starRating": 4,
  "coverImage": { "url": "...", "variants": [{ "variant": "card", "format": "webp", "url": "..." }] },
  "destination": { "id": "...", "name": "...", "path": "/georgia/..." },
  "startingFrom": { "totalCents": 52500, "perNightCents": 17500, "currency": "GEL" },
  "mealPlans": ["BB"], "refundable": true, "offerCount": 3,
  // Present only for a property that offers kosher services at all.
  "kosher": {
    "serviceLevel": "FULL", "offersKosher": true,
    "certified": true, "certificationState": "VERIFIED", "expiringSoon": false,
    "authorityName": "Chief Rabbinate of Georgia", "expiresOn": "2027-01-14"
  },
  "cheapestOffer": { /* offer, below */ }
}
```

`certified` is **derived**, never stored: it needs a VERIFIED, unexpired,
property-scoped certificate. No admin field sets it and no amenity produces it,
so a property with every kosher facility ticked and no certificate comes back
`certified: false`. `certificationState` folds expiry in and is computed on
every read — a certificate that lapsed overnight reports `EXPIRED` at 00:01
without any job having run.

**Offer** — the unit taken into checkout.

```jsonc
{
  "token": "…signed…",
  "roomTypeId": "...", "ratePlanId": "...", "name": "Breakfast, flexible",
  "terms": {
    "mealPlan": { "code": "BB", "name": "Bed & Breakfast" },
    "cancellation": { "kind": "FLEXIBLE", "freeUntil": "2027-06-01T10:00:00.000Z", "refundable": true },
    "payment": { "timing": "PAY_NOW", "depositBps": null }
  },
  "quote": {
    "currency": "GEL",
    "nights": [{ "date": "2027-06-01", "sellCents": 17500 }],
    "taxes": { "includedCents": 0, "payableAtPropertyCents": 0, "applied": [] },
    "totals": { "nights": 3, "roomCents": 52500, "totalCents": 52500 }
  },
  "occupancy": { "extraBedsNeeded": 0, "extraGuests": 0 },
  "availableUnits": 5,
  "freeCancellationUntil": "2027-06-01T10:00:00.000Z"
}
```

`quote.nights[].netCents`, `quote.totals.netCents`, `markupBps`, `marginCents`
are **staff** only.

Errors: `409 { reason: 'PRICE_CHANGED', quotedCents, currentCents }`,
`409 { reason: 'UNAVAILABLE' }`, `410` for an expired token.

## Bookings

| Method | Path | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/bookings/holds` | `{ token }` → hold. 409 if gone |
| DELETE | `/bookings/holds/:token` | Always 204 |
| POST | `/bookings` | `{ holdToken \| offerToken, leadGuest, guests?, specialRequests?, requests? }`. Send `Idempotency-Key` |
| GET | `/bookings/:reference` | Guests must add `?email=` |
| PATCH | `/bookings/:reference` | Amend paperwork only. `{ leadGuest?, specialRequests?, requests?, email? }` |
| GET | `/bookings/:reference/cancellation-quote` | `?email=` for guests |
| POST | `/bookings/:reference/cancel` | `{ reason?, email? }` |
| GET | `/partner/bookings` | Own bookings. `?status&from&to&search&page&pageSize` |
| GET | `/partner/dashboard` | `{ partner, stats: { listings, bookings, upcoming, cancelled } }` |

**There is no field for an amount.** The schema is strict; sending one is a 400.
`201` on create, `200` when a replay.

**Structured requirements** travel in `requests`, alongside `specialRequests`
rather than instead of it:

```jsonc
"requests": [
  { "code": "kosherMealOnRequest", "note": "Two kosher dinners, Fri and Sat" },
  { "code": "shabbatElevator" }
]
```

Each `code` is checked against what the property actually offers — its own
kosher-category amenities, plus `kosherMealOnRequest`, which any kosher property
may be asked for. A code it does not offer is a **422**:

```jsonc
{ "error": { "message": "This property does not offer some of those requirements",
             "details": { "unsupported": ["mikvehOnSite"] } } }
```

The check runs *before* any inventory is claimed, so a refused request leaves no
hold and no booking behind it.

**Requirements do not gate confirmation.** The rooms were claimed and priced, so
the booking is `CONFIRMED` and each requirement carries its own
`REQUESTED → CONFIRMED | DECLINED` status. Every booking response carries
`requestsPending`, and the detail carries the rows:

```jsonc
"requestsPending": 1,
"requests": [
  { "id": "...", "code": "kosherMealOnRequest", "note": "…",
    "status": "CONFIRMED", "respondedAt": "…", "responseNote": null }
]
```

On a `PATCH`, `requests` is the **whole set**: withdrawing one means sending the
list without it. A requirement the property has already answered is left alone —
re-asking cannot undo a refusal — though its note may still be corrected.

**Amendments are paperwork only.** `PATCH` reaches the lead guest's name,
email and phone, and the special requests — nothing that was priced. Dates,
rooms, board and party are not in the schema, because changing them means
releasing inventory and re-quoting: cancel and book again. Allowed while the
booking is `PENDING` or `CONFIRMED`; anything else is a `409` carrying the
status. Authorization is the same as a read, so a partner amends its own and a
guest amends theirs by quoting `email`.

**Booking detail**

```jsonc
{
  "reference": "BKG-000001", "status": "CONFIRMED",
  "hotel": { "id": "...", "name": "...", "slug": "..." },
  "hotelSnapshot": { /* name, address, phone, timezone, checkIn/checkOut times */ },
  "checkIn": "2027-06-01", "checkOut": "2027-06-04", "nights": 3, "rooms": 1,
  "leadGuestName": "...", "leadGuestEmail": "...",
  "currency": "GEL", "totalCents": 52500, "payableAtPropertyCents": 0,
  "bookingRooms": [{
    "id": "...", "status": "CONFIRMED",
    "roomTypeName": "Deluxe Double", "ratePlanName": "...",
    "mealPlan": { "code": "BB", "name": "..." },
    "bedConfiguration": "1 x King Bed",
    "cancellation": { "freeUntil": "...", "windows": [{ "fromAt": null, "toAt": "...", "chargeCents": 0 }] },
    "sellSubtotalCents": 52500,
    "nights": [{ "date": "2027-06-01", "sellCents": 17500 }],
    "guests": [{ "type": "ADULT", "firstName": "...", "isLead": true }]
  }]
}
```

Names come from the **snapshot**, not the live hotel. **staff**:
`netTotalCents`, `markupBps`, `marginCents`, `partner`, per-night `netCents`.

## Transfers

Point-to-point ground transport. The shape mirrors hotels — a signed quote
carried into an idempotent booking — with one structural difference: **there is
no inventory and there are no holds.** A private transfer is dispatched from an
elastic fleet, so nothing has to be claimed. What can stop a sale is a road
closing, which is a blackout.

### Catalogue

| Method | Path | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/transfers/points` | The picker. `?search&kind&popular&locale`. Matches names, regions, IATA codes and every translation |
| GET | `/transfers/routes` | `?tier&category&featured&fromSlug&toSlug&search&locale&page&pageSize` |
| GET | `/transfers/routes/:slug` | Route landing page, with `stops[]` |
| GET | `/transfers/vehicles` | The fleet. `?vehicleClass&kind&locale` |
| GET | `/transfers/vehicles/:slug` | |
| GET | `/transfers/extras` | Child seats, ski carriage, extra stops |

Only `ACTIVE` rows are returned. A vehicle class is B2B by default — an
anonymous visitor sees only `b2cEnabled` classes, a signed-in partner sees the
whole active fleet, exactly as hotels work.

### Quotes

| Method | Path | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/transfers/quotes` | `?from&to&date&time&tripType&returnDate&returnTime&adults&children&luggage&cabinBags&extra&locale` |
| POST | `/transfers/quotes/revalidate` | `{ token }` → re-priced offer. Not strict: it shows the new fare rather than refusing |

`from` and `to` are point slugs or ids. `extra` repeats: `?extra=childSeat&extra=skiEquipment`.

**Pricing is two-tier.** A curated `TransferRoutePrice` is used when one exists;
otherwise the fare is `max(minimumFare, distanceKm × perKm) + airportFee` from
the vehicle class. So every pair of points is bookable, and the ones that matter
commercially are priced by hand. The response says which was used — but only to
staff, in `quote.legs[].source`.

**Quote result**

```jsonc
{
  "from": { "id": "...", "slug": "tbilisi-airport", "name": "...", "kind": "AIRPORT", "code": "TBS", "region": "Tbilisi", "timezone": "Asia/Tbilisi" },
  "to": { /* the same shape */ },
  "route": { "slug": "tbilisi-airport-to-gudauri", "tier": "TIER_1", "distanceKm": 128, "startingFromCents": 12776 },
  "closed": false,
  "offers": [{
    "token": "…signed…",
    "vehicle": { "slug": "comfort-sedan-private-transfer", "name": "Comfort Sedan", "vehicleClass": "COMFORT", "body": "sedan", "kind": "PRIVATE", "maxPassengers": 3, "features": ["airConditioning"] },
    "quote": {
      "currency": "GEL",
      "perSeat": false,
      "legs": [{
        "direction": "OUTBOUND", "from": "…", "to": "…",
        "pickupAt": "2027-02-10T05:00:00.000Z",
        "distanceKm": 128, "durationMinutes": 135, "isNight": false,
        "baseFareCents": 17116, "nightSurchargeCents": 0,
        "extras": [{ "code": "childSeat", "quantity": 1, "totalCents": 2000 }],
        "sellCents": 17116
      }],
      "totals": { "sellCents": 17116, "totalCents": 17116 }
    }
  }]
}
```

`legs[].netCents`, `legs[].source`, `totals.netCents`, `markupBps`,
`marginCents` and the vehicle's `fallbackPricing` are **staff** only.

`closed: true` with an empty `offers` array means the road is shut for those
dates — a real answer, not an error.

Errors: `404` for a point we do not serve, `409 { reason: 'SAME_POINT' }`,
`422 { reason: 'TOO_SOON' | 'BEYOND_HORIZON' | 'RETURN_BEFORE_OUTBOUND' | 'PARTY_TOO_LARGE' }`,
`410` for an expired token.

A party that no vehicle can carry returns `200` with no offers. Capacity is a
hard constraint, not a filter.

### Transfer bookings

| Method | Path | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/transfers/bookings` | `{ quoteToken, leadPassenger, flightNumber?, pickupAddress?, dropoffAddress?, specialRequests?, preferredDriverId?, preferredFleetVehicleId? }`. Send `Idempotency-Key` |
| GET | `/transfers/bookings/:reference` | Travellers must add `?email=` |
| PATCH | `/transfers/bookings/:reference` | Paperwork only |
| GET | `/transfers/bookings/:reference/cancellation-quote` | |
| POST | `/transfers/bookings/:reference/cancel` | `{ reason?, email? }` |
| GET | `/partner/transfers/bookings` | Own bookings. `?status&from&to&search&page&pageSize` |

References are `TRF-000001`. **There is no field for an amount**; the schema is
strict, so sending one is a 400. `201` on create, `200` on a replay.

**A partner may name the driver.** `preferredDriverId` (and optionally which
of that driver's cars, `preferredFleetVehicleId`) is honoured for a partner
session or operations; a guest sending it is a 400. The driver has to be one
`POST /partner/drivers/available` would list — verified, active, in a car on
the road that is sold as the booked class and big enough for the party — or
the answer is 422 `DRIVER_NOT_ELIGIBLE`. The offer is written for every leg in
the same transaction as the booking: a driver who was taken in the meantime is
409 `DRIVER_UNAVAILABLE` and nothing is written, so the partner chooses again
(or omits the field and lets dispatch assign). The driver still has to accept;
until then the booking's `legs[].assignment` carries them with
`awaitingDriver: true`.

**Amendments are paperwork only** — the lead passenger, their phone, the flight
number and the two addresses. The journey, the vehicle, the date and the party
are not in the schema, because changing any of them changes the fare: cancel and
book again. Allowed while `PENDING` or `CONFIRMED`, otherwise a `409` carrying
the status.

**Cancellation reads only the schedule frozen at confirmation.** The vehicle's
current policy is never consulted, so terms tightened later cannot change what
an earlier traveller is owed.

**Booking detail**

```jsonc
{
  "reference": "TRF-000001", "status": "CONFIRMED", "tripType": "ONE_WAY",
  "pickupAt": "2027-02-10T05:00:00.000Z", "returnPickupAt": null,
  "route": { /* snapshot: fromName, toName, distanceKm, stops[] */ },
  "vehicle": { /* snapshot: name, vehicleClass, providerName, pickupProcedure */ },
  "adults": 2, "children": 0, "luggage": 2,
  "leadPassengerName": "...", "leadPassengerEmail": "...",
  "flightNumber": "TK378", "pickupAddress": "Terminal 1, arrivals",
  "currency": "GEL", "totalCents": 17116,
  "cancellation": { "freeUntil": "...", "windows": [{ "fromAt": null, "toAt": "...", "chargeCents": 0 }] },
  "legs": [{ "legIndex": 0, "direction": "OUTBOUND", "from": "...", "to": "...", "pickupAt": "...", "sellCents": 17116 }],
  "extras": [{ "code": "childSeat", "quantity": 1, "totalCents": 2000 }]
}
```

Names come from the **snapshot**, not the live route. **staff**:
`netTotalCents`, `markupBps`, `marginCents`, `partner`, per-leg `netCents`.

### Transfer admin

All under `/admin/transfers/*`, guarded by `authenticate + requireAdmin`.

| Method | Path |
| --- | --- |
| GET/POST | `/admin/transfers/points` · GET/PATCH/DELETE `/points/:id` |
| PUT | `/admin/transfers/points/:id/translations/:locale` |
| GET/POST | `/admin/transfers/vehicles` · GET/PATCH `/vehicles/:id` · POST `/vehicles/:id/archive` |
| PUT | `/admin/transfers/vehicles/:id/translations/:locale` |
| GET/POST | `/admin/transfers/routes` · GET/PATCH `/routes/:id` |
| **PUT** | `/admin/transfers/routes/prices` — the bulk editor |
| PUT | `/admin/transfers/routes/:id/prices` · `/stops` · `/translations/:locale` |
| POST | `/admin/transfers/routes/:id/publish` · `/unpublish` · `/archive` |
| GET/POST/PUT/DELETE | `/admin/transfers/extras[/:code]` |
| GET/POST/DELETE | `/admin/transfers/blackouts[/:id]` |
| GET | `/admin/transfers/bookings` · `/:reference` · POST `/:reference/cancel` |

### Seeding the transfer catalogue

```
node scripts/seed-reference.js              # first — shared policy templates
node scripts/seed-transfers.js              # 67 points, 9 classes, 396 routes, 3,564 prices
node scripts/seed-transfer-translations.js  # ka/ru/he, recovered from git history
node scripts/seed-transfer-bookings.js      # demo bookings, for a panel with data in it
node scripts/seed-transfer-bookings.js --clear
```

All four are idempotent and none of them deletes anything an operator has
changed — a re-run refreshes editorial fields and leaves every curated price
where it was. `seed-transfer-bookings.js` goes through the real quote and
confirmation path rather than inserting rows, so if it runs, the booking path
runs; its records carry `source: 'demo'` and `@demo.iamgeorgia.test` addresses,
which is what `--clear` matches.

`DELETE /points/:id` **retires** rather than deletes — routes and bookings
reference the row with `Restrict`, and a place that has ever been travelled to
has to stay readable.

Every route mutation returns the route plus `publishChecklist: [{ code, message }]`.
`POST /publish` answers **422** with `details.missing` when a route has no price
at all, because publishing one would silently fall through to the distance
estimate. Missing copy is listed but does not block.

**Route price grid** (whole-grid PUT, so a half-applied grid is impossible):

```jsonc
{ "prices": [{ "vehicleId": "...", "oneWayCents": 17500, "returnCents": null, "netCents": null }] }
```

**Bulk repricing:**

```jsonc
{ "tier": "TIER_1", "vehicleIds": ["..."], "perKmCents": 150, "overwrite": false }
```

Either `perKmCents` or `flatCents`, never both. **A filter is required** —
`tier`, `category` or `routeIds` — there is deliberately no way to reprice the
whole catalogue in one call. `overwrite` defaults to false, so the ordinary use
fills gaps and leaves every figure someone has already set. Returns
`{ routes, written, kept }`.

---

### Operations roles and the driver identity

Two platform-side roles exist beside the admins. `DISPATCHER` may read every
transfer booking (`GET /api/admin/transfers/bookings`, `GET
/api/admin/transfers/bookings/:reference`) and, from the dispatch phase on,
manage cars, drivers and assignments — but not the catalogue, the fares, the
partners or the money: the summary and detail shapes carry `netTotalCents`,
`markupBps` and `marginCents` for admins only. `DRIVER` reaches nothing under
`/api/partner/*` or `/api/admin/*`; its own routes arrive with the driver
panel.

`GET /api/auth/me` answers with a third field, `driver`, beside `user` and
`partner`: the driver's own profile for a `DRIVER` account (`null` until an
operations user has linked one), and `null` for everyone else.

```json
{
  "user": { "role": "DRIVER", "partnerId": null, "...": "..." },
  "partner": null,
  "driver": {
    "id": "…", "firstName": "Levan", "lastName": "Gogoladze",
    "photo": null, "languages": ["ka", "en"], "yearsExperience": 7, "bio": null,
    "verified": true, "ratingAvg": 0, "ratingCount": 0, "completedCount": 0,
    "phone": "+995555000111", "email": null,
    "provider": { "id": "…", "name": "I am Georgia fleet" },
    "verificationStatus": "VERIFIED", "isActive": true, "licenceExpiresOn": null,
    "homeBasePoint": null, "vehicles": []
  }
}
```

The licence number, date of birth, internal notes and documents are never in
this shape, nor in the one a partner sees; they exist only in the operations
view.

### Fleet and drivers (operations)

`/api/admin/transfers/fleet` and `/api/admin/transfers/drivers` are open to
`SUPER_ADMIN`, `ADMIN` and `DISPATCHER`. Every response is the operations
view; a document response never carries a URL — the bytes are reached through
the `…/url` endpoint, which authorises and writes a `PRIVATE_FILE_ACCESSED`
audit row.

| Method | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/admin/transfers/fleet` | `providerId`, `vehicleClassId`, `status` (repeatable), `search` (make, model, plate however spelt), `page`, `pageSize` |
| POST | `/admin/transfers/fleet` | 201. 409 `field: plateNumber` when the normalised plate is already on a non-archived car |
| GET / PATCH | `/admin/transfers/fleet/:id` | PATCH refuses `status: ARCHIVED` (400) — use the action |
| POST | `/admin/transfers/fleet/:id/archive` | 409 `reason: ACTIVE_ASSIGNMENTS` with the bookings while a live assignment names the car |
| POST | `/admin/transfers/fleet/:id/activate` | DRAFT / INACTIVE / ARCHIVED → ACTIVE; 409 if the plate has since been reissued |
| DELETE | `/admin/transfers/fleet/:id` | **Admin only.** A real delete, open only while no assignment names the car: 409 `HAS_ASSIGNMENTS` (with the count) once it has been on a job — archive instead. Photographs and documents nothing else references are removed with it |
| GET / POST | `/admin/transfers/fleet/:id/images` | Gallery, as for hotels. The cover is mirrored onto `mainImage` |
| PATCH / DELETE | `/admin/transfers/fleet/:id/images/:imageId` | |
| PUT | `/admin/transfers/fleet/:id/images/order` | `{ order: [imageId…] }`, every image exactly once |
| GET / POST | `/admin/transfers/fleet/:id/documents` | `docType` ∈ REGISTRATION, INSURANCE, TECHNICAL_INSPECTION, OTHER; the asset must be PRIVATE |
| GET | `/admin/transfers/fleet/:id/documents/:documentId/url` | Short-lived signed link, audited |
| DELETE | `/admin/transfers/fleet/:id/documents/:documentId` | The bytes stay in the media library |
| GET | `/admin/transfers/drivers` | `providerId`, `verificationStatus` (repeatable), `isActive` (`true`/`false`), `search`, `page`, `pageSize` |
| POST | `/admin/transfers/drivers` | 201. `languages` is a closed ISO 639-1 list |
| GET / PATCH | `/admin/transfers/drivers/:id` | |
| POST | `/admin/transfers/drivers/:id/verify` | `{ status, note? }`. VERIFIED stamps who and when; anything else clears both |
| POST | `/admin/transfers/drivers/:id/deactivate` | `{ reason, force? }`. 409 `ACTIVE_ASSIGNMENTS` unless `force`, which revokes them and returns their legs to UNASSIGNED. Ends the login's sessions |
| POST | `/admin/transfers/drivers/:id/activate` | |
| DELETE | `/admin/transfers/drivers/:id` | **Admin only.** A real delete, open only while no assignment names the driver: 409 `HAS_ASSIGNMENTS` once they have been on a job — deactivate instead. Takes the `DRIVER` login (and its sessions) with the profile, and the documents and photo nothing else references |
| POST | `/admin/transfers/drivers/:id/account` | `{ email }`. Creates the `DRIVER` login and emails `driverAccountActivation`. Returns `{ driver, link: { kind: 'activation', url, expiresAt }, email, emailSent }` so the admin can copy the link themselves. 409 if one exists or the email is taken |
| POST | `/admin/transfers/drivers/:id/account/resend` | Same response shape, with a fresh link. 409 once the account has a password |
| PUT | `/admin/transfers/drivers/:id/vehicles` | `{ vehicles: [{ fleetVehicleId, isPrimary }] }`, replaced as a whole; at most one primary |
| GET / POST / DELETE | `/admin/transfers/drivers/:id/documents[/:documentId]` | `docType` ∈ DRIVING_LICENCE, ID_DOCUMENT, MEDICAL, BACKGROUND_CHECK, OTHER |
| GET | `/admin/transfers/drivers/:id/documents/:documentId/url` | Signed link, audited |

`/api/admin/media` is likewise open to dispatchers for the four fleet and
driver categories (`FLEET_IMAGE`, `DRIVER_PHOTO`, `DRIVER_DOCUMENT`,
`VEHICLE_DOCUMENT`) and nothing else: an upload in another category is 403,
a read of another category's file is 404, and delete stays admin-only.

### Dispatch (operations)

`/api/admin/transfers/dispatch`, open to `SUPER_ADMIN`, `ADMIN` and `DISPATCHER`.
A *leg* is the unit of dispatch — a return booking is two. Each leg carries an
operational `status` (`UNASSIGNED → ASSIGNED → ACCEPTED → EN_ROUTE → ARRIVED →
ON_BOARD → COMPLETED`, with `NO_SHOW_REPORTED → NO_SHOW` and `CANCELLED`
beside it) and at most one live assignment. The booking's own `status` is
unchanged by any of this until every leg is terminal, when it rolls up to
`COMPLETED` or `NO_SHOW`.

| Method | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/dispatch/legs` | `from`, `to` (dates), `legStatus` (repeatable), `driverId`, `search`; each row carries `booking`, `assignment` and `allowedTransitions` |
| GET | `/dispatch/legs/:legId` | |
| GET | `/dispatch/legs/:legId/candidates` | Active drivers with an active car of the booked class, ranked, with those cars and any conflicts in the leg's window |
| POST | `/dispatch/legs/:legId/assign` | `{ driverId, fleetVehicleId?, acceptOnBehalf?, overrideUnverified?, overrideClassMismatch?, overrideVehicleLink?, windowEndOverride?, note? }`. 201. Reassigns when the leg is already held. 422 `CAPACITY`; 422 `OVERRIDE_REQUIRED` with `overrides[]`; 409 `SCHEDULE_CONFLICT` with `conflicts[]` |
| POST | `/dispatch/legs/:legId/unassign` | `{ reason }` |
| POST | `/dispatch/legs/:legId/status` | `{ to, expectedFrom?, note? }` on behalf of the driver, or an operations-only move (`NO_SHOW`, corrections). 409 `STALE_STATE`, `INVALID_TRANSITION`, `TOO_EARLY` |
| POST | `/dispatch/legs/:legId/cancel` | One leg only — a return whose outbound already ran |
| GET | `/dispatch/assignments` | History: `driverId`, `fleetVehicleId`, `status`, `from`, `to` |
| GET | `/dispatch/assignments/:id` | |
| GET | `/dispatch/schedule` | `driverId` \| `fleetVehicleId` \| `providerId`, `from`, `to`: every live claim on the resource's time, jobs and blocks alike |
| GET / POST | `/dispatch/blocks` | A block names one driver or one car; 409 `SCHEDULE_CONFLICT` while a job sits inside it |
| DELETE | `/dispatch/blocks/:id` | |

Occupancy is pick-up minus `TRANSFER_DISPATCH_PRE_BUFFER_MINUTES` to the end
of the journey plus `TRANSFER_DISPATCH_POST_BUFFER_MINUTES`, stored on the
assignment. Two dispatchers offering the same driver overlapping legs get one
201 and one 409: the service locks the driver's row and checks the occupancy
view under it, and the database's exclusion constraints refuse the overlap
regardless.

### The driver panel

`/api/driver`, for `DRIVER` accounts with a linked, active profile. Every
query is scoped on the session's driver; another driver's assignment is a
404. Nothing here ever carries a fare.

| Method | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| GET / PATCH | `/driver/me` | PATCH accepts `phone`, `languages`, `bio` only |
| GET | `/driver/vehicles` | The cars linked to the driver |
| GET | `/driver/assignments` | `scope=today|upcoming|history` |
| GET | `/driver/assignments/:id` | The job, the passenger block, the car, the milestones and `allowedTransitions` |
| POST | `/driver/assignments/:id/accept` | 409 `ASSIGNMENT_NOT_ACTIVE` once the offer has been withdrawn |
| POST | `/driver/assignments/:id/decline` | `{ reason? }`. An accepted job may be declined until `TRANSFER_DISPATCH_LATE_DECLINE_HOURS` before pick-up; after that, 409 `LATE_DECLINE` |
| POST | `/driver/assignments/:id/status` | `{ to, expectedFrom?, note? }`. Forward skips fill the milestones they jumped; every timestamp is the server's |

### What a partner and a passenger see

`GET /api/partner/transfers/bookings/:reference` (new) and the guest lookup
`GET /api/transfers/bookings/:reference?email=` carry `legs[].status` and
`legs[].assignment`. The assignment is `null` until the driver has accepted;
then it holds the driver's public profile (`firstName`, `lastName` — the
initial only for a passenger — photo, languages, experience, `verified`,
rating and completed counts), the car, and the milestones. `driver.phone` is
present only from `TRANSFER_DISPATCH_CONTACT_REVEAL_HOURS` before pick-up.
The one exception is the driver the partner asked for at checkout: that
offer is shown while it waits, with `awaitingDriver: true` and no phone
number, so the partner can see whom they asked for. An offer a dispatcher
made stays hidden until it is answered.

**Choosing a driver at checkout.** `POST /api/partner/drivers/available`
`{ token }` — the quote token from the results page — answers with the
drivers a partner may ask for: `{ vehicleClass, legs: [{ direction, pickupAt,
windowStart, windowEnd }], drivers: [...] }`. Each driver is the public
profile plus `provider` and `cars`, every car of the booked class that is
linked to them, on the road, big enough for the party and free across every
leg (with its gallery). Verified, active drivers only; the list is advice,
and the booking call checks again under the driver's row lock. Approved
partners and admins; 401 / 403 otherwise. `GET /api/partner/drivers/:id` now
also answers for a driver the partner has requested but who has not yet
accepted.

### Ratings and notifications

One rating per completed leg, 1–5 with optional words. Who may leave it:

| Who | How | Endpoint |
|---|---|---|
| The lead passenger | the link emailed after the transfer (`transferRatingInvite`), signed with `TRANSFER_RATING_TOKEN_SECRET` and valid for `TRANSFER_RATING_WINDOW_DAYS` | `POST /api/transfers/ratings` `{ token, score, comment? }` |
| The partner | from the portal, on one of its own bookings | `POST /api/partner/transfers/bookings/:reference/legs/:legIndex/rating` |
| Operations | feedback taken by phone | `POST /api/admin/transfers/dispatch/legs/:legId/rating` |

First submission wins; a second is 409 `ALREADY_RATED`. A rating without a
comment is `PUBLISHED` at once; one with a comment is `PENDING` until
operations publish or reject it (`GET /api/admin/transfers/dispatch/ratings`,
`POST …/ratings/:id/publish|reject`). The driver's `ratingAvg` /
`ratingCount` and the provider's `rating` / `reviewCount` are recomputed from
the published rows inside the same transaction — never incremented, never
editable. `GET /api/driver/me/ratings` gives a driver the average, the count
and the score distribution, never the comments. `GET /api/partner/drivers/:id`
gives a partner the public profile, cars and published reviews of a driver
who has held an accepted assignment on one of its bookings; anyone else is
404.

Notifications ride a transactional outbox: every dispatch write enqueues an
event in its own transaction, and a sweeper (`TRANSFER_OUTBOX_DRAIN_INTERVAL_MS`)
turns events into in-app rows and emails under an advisory lock, retrying a
failed handler with backoff. A second sweeper
(`TRANSFER_REMINDER_SWEEP_INTERVAL_MS`) enqueues the time-driven ones — the
driver's reminder two hours before pick-up, the passenger's driver details at
`TRANSFER_DISPATCH_CONTACT_REVEAL_HOURS`, and the "still no driver" alert for
a confirmed leg within a day (also emailed to `TRANSFER_OPS_EMAIL`). Each is
stamped on the leg in the statement that selects it, so it fires once.
Drivers read theirs at `GET /api/driver/notifications` (`unread=true`) and
mark them with `POST /api/driver/notifications/:id/read` or `…/read-all`.

## Admin

All under `/admin/*`, guarded by `authenticate + requireAdmin`.

### Hotels

| Method | Path |
| --- | --- |
| GET / POST | `/admin/hotels` |
| GET / PATCH | `/admin/hotels/:id` |
| POST | `/admin/hotels/:id/publish` · `/unpublish` · `/archive` |
| PUT | `/admin/hotels/:id/amenities` — `{ amenities: [{ amenityId, note? }] }` |
| POST / PATCH / DELETE | `/admin/hotels/:id/images` · `/images/:imageId` |
| PUT | `/admin/hotels/:id/images/order` — `{ order: [imageId] }` |
| PUT | `/admin/hotels/:id/translations/:locale` |
| GET / PUT / DELETE | `/admin/hotels/:id/kosher` |
| POST | `/admin/hotels/:id/kosher/certifications` |
| PATCH / DELETE | `…/kosher/certifications/:certId` |
| POST | `…/kosher/certifications/:certId/verify` |
| GET / POST | `/admin/hotels/:id/documents` |
| DELETE | `/admin/hotels/:id/documents/:documentId` |
| POST | `/admin/bookings/:reference/requests/:requestId` |

`GET /admin/hotels/:id` and every mutation return the hotel plus
`publishChecklist: [{ code, message }]`. `POST /publish` answers **422** with
`details.missing` when it is not empty. There is no DELETE.

Create takes only: `slug, name, propertyType, destinationId, starRating,
supplierId?, countryCode?, timezone?, currency?`. Everything else is PATCH.

### Kosher

`PUT /admin/hotels/:id/kosher` creates the record, and **creating it is the
switch**: a hotel with no kosher row shows no kosher block anywhere, matches no
kosher filter, and renders no kosher admin section.

```jsonc
// PUT /admin/hotels/:id/kosher   → 201 on create, 200 on update
{ "serviceLevel": "FULL", "notes": "Glatt kosher kitchen.",
  "contactName": "Front office", "contactEmail": "kosher@example.ge" }
```

`serviceLevel` is required — the column's default exists so it can be NOT NULL,
not so the API can classify a property nobody assessed.

**There is no `verification` field in any of these schemas.** Marking a
certificate verified is `POST …/certifications/:certId/verify`, a transition of
its own with its own audit action — the same treatment `status` gets on a hotel.
`PATCH /admin/hotels/:id` is strict and has no kosher key at all, so no ordinary
hotel update can reach certification.

```jsonc
// POST …/kosher/certifications/:certId/verify
{ "decision": "VERIFIED" | "REJECTED" | "PENDING_VERIFICATION", "notes": "…" }
```

`notes` is required for anything but an approval. Editing a verified
certificate's authority, reference, scope, dates or document withdraws its
verification and clears the verifier: verification attaches to a set of facts,
not to a row id. Every mutation answers with the **whole** kosher block,
re-derived.

`DELETE /admin/hotels/:id/kosher` is a **409** while a live certificate exists —
removing the record would cascade its history away with it. Archive first, or
set `serviceLevel: "NONE"`.

Facilities are **not** written here. They are ordinary amenities in the
`KosherFood`, `Shabbat` and `Religious` categories, written through
`PUT /admin/hotels/:id/amenities` like any other, and *projected* into
`kosher.features` on read — so there is exactly one place a facility lives.

### Documents

`HotelDocument` is the private file library: a `docType` machine key, an optional
`validUntil`, and no URL anywhere in the response. Reaching the bytes is
`GET /admin/media/:id/url`, which is authorized and audited as
`PRIVATE_FILE_ACCESSED`. Attaching requires a **private** asset; upload it as
`KOSHER_CERTIFICATE` (PDF or an image, stored private, no gallery renditions).
Detaching is a 409 while a verified certificate points at it.

### Rooms, rates, inventory

| Method | Path |
| --- | --- |
| GET / POST | `/admin/hotels/:hotelId/room-types` |
| GET / PATCH | `…/room-types/:roomTypeId` |
| POST | `…/room-types/:roomTypeId/archive` |

| GET / PATCH | `…/rate-plans/:ratePlanId` |
| POST | `…/rate-plans/:id/archive` |
| POST/PUT/DELETE | `…/rate-plans/:id/restrictions[/:restrictionId]` |
| **PUT** | `…/room-types/:id/inventory` — the bulk editor |
| **GET** | `…/room-types/:id/inventory/calendar?from&to` |
| **PUT** | `…/rate-plans/:id/rates` — the bulk editor |
| GET / PUT | `/admin/hotels/:id/child-policy` |

| GET / PUT | `/admin/hotels/:id/meal-plans` |
| GET/POST/PUT/DELETE | `/admin/hotels/:id/tax-fees[/:taxFeeId]` |

**Bulk range body** (both inventory and rates):

```jsonc
{ "from": "2027-12-01", "to": "2027-12-31",
  "weekdays": [1,2,3,4],           // ISO, 1=Mon. Omit for every day
  "totalUnits": 5, "stopSell": false, "minStay": 2,
  "closedToArrival": false, "closedToDeparture": false }
```

```jsonc
{ "from": "2027-12-01", "to": "2027-12-31", "weekdays": [5,6,7],
  "netCents": 12500, "sellCents": null,
  "extraAdultCents": 3000, "extraChildCents": null, "singleOccupancyCents": null,
  "closed": false }
```

**Anything omitted keeps its existing value.** Returns `{ nights, days }`.
409 with `details.conflicts[{ date, committed }]` if a reduction would oversell.

**Calendar response**

```jsonc
{ "roomType": { "id": "...", "name": "...", "code": "..." },
  "nights": [{
    "date": "2027-12-01",
    "totalUnits": 5, "blockedUnits": 0, "bookedUnits": 1, "heldUnits": 0,
    "availableUnits": 4,
    "stopSell": false, "minStay": null, "closedToArrival": false, "closedToDeparture": false,
    "rates": [{ "ratePlanId": "...", "ratePlanName": "...", "netCents": 12500, "sellCents": null, "closed": false }]
  }] }
```

### Everything else

| Method | Path |
| --- | --- |
| GET/POST | `/admin/destinations`, `GET /admin/destinations/tree` |
| GET/PATCH/DELETE | `/admin/destinations/:id` |
| PUT | `/admin/destinations/:id/translations/:locale` |
| GET/POST | `/admin/amenities`, `GET/PATCH /admin/amenities/:id` |
| GET/POST | `/admin/media` (multipart: `file`, `category`, `altText?`) |
| GET/DELETE | `/admin/media/:id`, `GET /admin/media/:id/url` (signed, private only) |
| GET | `/admin/bookings`, `/admin/bookings/:reference` |
| POST | `/admin/bookings/:reference/cancel` |
| GET/POST | `/admin/pricing-rules`, `GET /admin/pricing-rules/explain?partnerId&hotelId` |
| PUT/DELETE | `/admin/pricing-rules/:id` |

Media categories decide visibility, not the caller: `HOTEL_IMAGE`, `ROOM_IMAGE`,
`AMENITY_ICON` are public; `CONTRACT`, `RATE_SHEET`, `INVOICE`, `VOUCHER`,
`IMPORT`, `OTHER` are private and have **no URL** — fetch `/url` for a
60-second signed link.

## Supplier extranet

`/partner/hotels`, guarded by `authenticate + requireApprovedPartner`, scoped to
the caller's own properties. Another supplier's id returns **404, not 403**.

| Method | Path | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/partner/hotels` | any partner role |
| GET | `/partner/hotels/:hotelId` | any |
| GET | `/partner/hotels/:hotelId/room-types` | any |
| GET | `…/room-types/:id/inventory/calendar` | any |
| PUT | `…/room-types/:id/inventory` | **OWNER / ADMIN only** |
| PUT | `…/rate-plans/:id/rates` | **OWNER / ADMIN only** |
| GET | `/partner/hotels/:hotelId/bookings` | any |

A `PARTNER_AGENT` gets 403 on the two writes.
