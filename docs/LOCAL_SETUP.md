# Running "I am Georgia" locally

A step-by-step guide for anyone who needs the platform running on their own
machine — developers, testers, and anyone doing a demo. No prior knowledge of
the codebase is assumed.

If you only want to *test the API*, you still need everything in this document:
the API cannot answer a single meaningful request without a database behind it.

---

## 1. What you are installing

The project is two applications that talk to each other over HTTP and share
nothing else:

| Part | What it is | Runs on | Folder |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Server** | The API. Express 5 + Prisma 7. Everything under `/api`. | `http://localhost:5000` | `server/` |
| **Client** | The website. Next.js 16 + React 19. | `http://localhost:3000` | `client/` |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL 17 with PostGIS, run in Docker. | `localhost:5432` | `server/docker-compose.yml` |

The client calls the server. The server calls the database. Nothing else is
required — no Redis, no S3 account, no mail server — because each of those has
a local stand-in that is switched on by default in development.

---

## 2. Prerequisites

Install these before you start.

| Tool | Minimum version | Check it with | Where to get it |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Node.js** | 22.18.0 | `node -v` | <https://nodejs.org> (LTS) |
| **npm** | ships with Node | `npm -v` | — |
| **Docker Desktop** | any current | `docker -v` | <https://docker.com/products/docker-desktop> |
| **Git** | any current | `git --version` | <https://git-scm.com> |

> **Windows note.** Docker Desktop must be *running* (whale icon in the tray),
> not merely installed. If `docker ps` errors with "cannot connect to the Docker
> daemon", start Docker Desktop and wait for it to say "Engine running".

**Do you have to use Docker?** No. Docker is only how we run PostgreSQL. If you
already have PostgreSQL 17 with the PostGIS extension installed natively, skip
`npm run db:up` and point `DATABASE_URL` at your own instance instead.

---

## 3. Get the code

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd "I am Georgia"
```

You should see two folders, `client/` and `server/`.

---

## 4. Set up the server

Every command in this section runs from inside `server/`.

```bash
cd server
```

### 4.1 Create your environment file

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

`.env.example` is a fully commented template — every variable is explained in
it. **For local development the defaults work as they are.** You do not need to
edit anything to get started.

The values that matter most, and why:

| Variable | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PORT` | `5000` | Where the API listens. |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/iamgeorgia` | How the API reaches Postgres. Must match the `POSTGRES_*` values below it. |
| `CLIENT_ORIGIN` | `http://localhost:3000` | The one origin allowed to make browser calls with a session cookie. Both the CORS allowlist **and** the cross-site write check read this. |
| `APP_URL` | `http://localhost:3000` | Where the front end lives. Every invitation, activation and password-reset link in an email is built from this. |
| `MAIL_TRANSPORT` | `log` | `log` prints emails — links included — to the terminal instead of sending them. This is how you get activation links locally. |
| `AUTH_TOKEN_PEPPER` | a placeholder | Mixed into every token hash. Fine as-is locally; must be 32 random bytes in production. |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `debug` | How chatty the server is. |

> **Real `.env` files are never committed.** Only the `*.example` templates and
> `.env.test` live in the repository. Anything secret you put in `.env` stays on
> your machine.

### 4.2 Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This also runs `prisma generate` automatically (a `postinstall` hook), which
builds the typed database client. If you ever change `prisma/schema.prisma`, run
`npm run prisma:generate` again.

### 4.3 Start the database

```bash
npm run db:up
```

That is `docker compose up -d` — it pulls the `postgis/postgis:17-3.5-alpine`
image the first time (a minute or two) and starts a container called
`iamgeorgia-postgres`. Data lives in a Docker volume named `pgdata`, so it
survives restarts.

Confirm it is healthy:

```bash
docker ps
```

You want to see `iamgeorgia-postgres` with status `Up ... (healthy)`.

### 4.4 Create the database tables

```bash
npm run prisma:migrate
```

This applies every migration in `prisma/migrations/` — the full schema:
partners, users, sessions, destinations, hotels, room types, rate plans,
inventory, bookings, transfers and the audit log.

### 4.5 Seed the reference data

```bash
node scripts/seed-reference.js
```

**Run this before anything else that seeds.** It creates the shared vocabulary
the rest of the system depends on: amenities, bed types, meal plans and the
cancellation/payment policy templates. Without it, seeding a hotel fails.

### 4.6 Create the first administrator

```bash
node scripts/create-admin.js you@example.com Your Name
```

There is deliberately **no sign-up for administrators**. The first account comes
from this script; every account after it is invited from inside the admin panel.

The script prints a generated password **once**. Copy it somewhere safe — it is
never printed again and cannot be recovered. If you would rather choose it, pass
it as a fourth argument (minimum 12 characters, and it must not contain your own
name or email address):

```bash
node scripts/create-admin.js you@example.com Your Name "Str0ngLocalPass!"
```

### 4.7 Optional: seed a catalogue worth testing

An empty database technically works, but every search returns nothing. To get
real data:

```bash
# Hotels: 8 destinations, 9 Georgian properties, room types, rate plans,
# and roughly 400 days of nightly rates and inventory.
node scripts/seed-catalogue.js

# Transfers: 67 points, 9 vehicle classes, 396 routes, 3,564 curated prices.
node scripts/seed-transfers.js
node scripts/seed-transfer-translations.js   # ka / ru / he copy
node scripts/seed-transfer-bookings.js       # a few demo bookings
```

Every one of these is **idempotent** — re-running refreshes editorial fields and
never deletes anything an operator has changed. `seed-transfer-bookings.js`
books through the real quote-and-confirm path rather than inserting rows, so if
it succeeds, the booking path works.

To undo the demo bookings only: `node scripts/seed-transfer-bookings.js --clear`.

### 4.8 Start the API

```bash
npm run dev
```

`npm run dev` is `node --watch server.js` — it restarts on every file save. Use
`npm start` if you want it to stay put.

**Verify it:**

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/health
# {"status":"ok","uptime":3.42}

curl http://localhost:5000/health/db
# {"status":"ok","now":"2026-08-30T09:12:44.180Z"}
```

`/health` says the process is alive. `/health/db` says the database is reachable
— it is the one to check when something is wrong.

---

## 5. Set up the client

In a **second terminal**, from the repository root:

```bash
cd client
cp .env.local.example .env.local   # NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>.

Two things must agree or the browser will be blocked:

- `client/.env.local` — `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` must point at the API.
- `server/.env` — `CLIENT_ORIGIN` must list the client's origin.

The session cookie is `httpOnly` and only travels cross-origin when CORS says it
may, so a mismatch shows up as "logged out immediately" or a CORS error in the
browser console — not as a server error.

> The API URL is inlined into the browser bundle at build time, so it has to be
> a URL the *visitor's browser* can reach — not a Docker-internal hostname.

---

## 6. Where things are

| Path | What lives there |
| --- | --- |
| `server/app.js` | Builds the Express app. Deliberately never calls `listen()`. |
| `server/server.js` | Owns the process: listening, signals, shutdown. |
| `server/routes/` | One file per area. `routes/index.js` mounts them all under `/api`. |
| `server/services/` | The actual logic. Routes stay thin. |
| `server/validation/` | zod schemas. Parsed input lands on `req.valid`, never back on `req.body`. |
| `server/serializers/` | Decide what each role is allowed to see in a response. |
| `server/middleware/` | auth, csrf, rate limiting, validation, error handling. |
| `server/prisma/schema.prisma` | The data model. |
| `server/scripts/` | Seeds and one-off admin tools. |
| `server/test/` | The test suite. |
| `client/app/[locale]/` | Three route groups: `(site)`, `(portal)`, `(admin)`. |

---

## 7. Running the tests

```bash
cd server
npm test
```

That is `node --env-file=.env.test --test "test/*.test.js"` — Node's built-in
test runner with supertest driving the app over an ephemeral port.

`.env.test` pins mail to an in-memory outbox and media to a scratch directory,
so **no test needs credentials or a network**. Suites that need a database skip
themselves cleanly if Postgres is not running, rather than failing.

Run one file:

```bash
node --env-file=.env.test --test test/booking.test.js
```

---

## 8. Everyday commands

All from `server/`:

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | API with auto-restart on save |
| `npm start` | API without watching |
| `npm test` | Full test suite |
| `npm run db:up` | Start PostgreSQL |
| `npm run db:down` | Stop PostgreSQL (data survives — it is in a volume) |
| `npm run db:logs` | Follow the database log |
| `npm run db:psql` | Open a `psql` shell inside the container |
| `npm run prisma:migrate` | Create and apply a migration (development) |
| `npm run prisma:deploy` | Apply existing migrations (production) |
| `npm run prisma:generate` | Rebuild the Prisma client after a schema change |
| `npm run prisma:studio` | Browse the database in a GUI at `localhost:5555` |

---

## 9. Troubleshooting

**`ECONNREFUSED` on port 5432, or `/health/db` returns 503**
Postgres is not running. `npm run db:up`, then `docker ps` to confirm it is
healthy. On Windows, check Docker Desktop itself is started.

**`Port 5000 is already in use`**
Something else has the port. Either stop it, or set `PORT=5001` in `server/.env`
— and then update `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` in `client/.env.local` to match.

**The server refuses to boot and prints a configuration error**
That is intentional: both apps validate their configuration at startup and
refuse to run half-configured rather than serving broken responses. Read the
message — it names the variable — and check it against `.env.example`.

**`prisma generate` errors, or types look stale after pulling**

```bash
npm install && npm run prisma:generate && npm run prisma:migrate
```

**I never receive the invitation / activation / reset email**
You are not meant to. `MAIL_TRANSPORT=log` prints the whole message, link
included, into the server terminal. Search the log for the URL and paste it into
your browser.

**Everything 401s even though I logged in**
The session is an `httpOnly` cookie named `iag_session`. In a browser, check
`CLIENT_ORIGIN` matches the origin you are calling from. In Postman, make sure
the cookie jar is on and you are hitting the same host that issued the cookie.

**`429 Too many requests`**
You hit a rate limit — 100 requests/minute per IP globally, and tighter limits
on the auth endpoints (see the testing guide). They are counted in this
process's memory locally, so **restarting the server clears every counter**.

**I want to start from a completely clean database**

```bash
npm run db:down
docker volume ls                   # find the volume, usually server_pgdata
docker volume rm server_pgdata
npm run db:up
npm run prisma:migrate
node scripts/seed-reference.js
node scripts/create-admin.js you@example.com Your Name
```

This destroys all local data. That is the point.
