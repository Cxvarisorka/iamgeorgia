/**
 * Taking a route off sale for good.
 *
 * Archiving rather than deleting, for the usual reason — bookings reference
 * the route and a voucher has to keep describing the journey that was sold —
 * but with one distinction worth spelling out on the screen itself, because
 * the panel offers both and they look similar:
 *
 * **Unpublishing** is reversible and routine. The route drops out of the
 * public catalogue, keeps its fares, and goes back on sale with one click.
 * That is what an operator wants for a road closed until spring.
 *
 * **Archiving** is the end of the route. It is what you do when the journey
 * itself no longer exists as a product. Restoring is possible from here, but
 * it comes back as a draft that has to be published again — which is the right
 * amount of friction for something that was retired on purpose.
