/**
 * Deleting a service, and the two reasons the server refuses.
 *
 * They are different problems with different fixes and so are worded
 * separately: `IN_PACKAGE` means a template still names this service and the
 * operator must edit that package first, which they can do; `HAS_BOOKINGS`
 * means somebody has bought it and the record has to survive for the voucher
 * and the audit trail, so archiving is the only honest option.
 *
 * Collapsing both into "could not delete" would send an operator hunting for
 * a booking that does not exist.
