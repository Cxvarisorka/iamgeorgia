/**
 * One icon per kosher facility code, mirroring the `icon` column the seed
 * writes.
 *
 * Kept beside `amenityIcons.tsx` rather than inside it: that map is typed on
 * `AmenityId`, the fourteen-code union the prototype shipped with, and widening
 * it to `string` would remove the exhaustiveness check that stops somebody
 * adding an amenity there without an icon.
 *
 * `kosherIcon` falls back rather than throwing. A facility seeded on the server
 * and not yet mapped here should render with a generic mark, not crash a hotel
 * page.
