 * the platform sells — hotels, tours and transfers.
 *
 * `SignatureTours` is the one section that reads the API, and it reads it
 * through the session cookie — so this page renders on demand. Without a
 * boundary around it the whole document, hero included, waits on that call
 * before a single byte is flushed, which puts an API round-trip in front of
 * the LCP element. Behind Suspense the hero ships immediately and the rail
 * streams in after it.
