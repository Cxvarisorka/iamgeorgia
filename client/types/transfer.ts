/**
 * Transfers — private and shared point-to-point ground transport.
 *
 * Spelled exactly as `server/serializers/transfer.js` sends it, so nothing has
 * to be translated at the boundary. The same two conventions as the rest of the
 * live catalogue apply, and both used to be wrong here:
 *
 *   * **Money is integer minor units** and always arrives with its currency.
 *     The prototype carried plain-number dollars; every figure below is cents.
 *   * **Dates are `YYYY-MM-DD` strings** and times are 24-hour `HH:mm` wall
 *     clock at the pick-up point. Instants — `pickupAt` — are ISO strings and
 *     are what a schedule is ordered by.
 *
 * Fields marked "staff only" are *absent* rather than null for anyone who may
 * not see them, so `in` and `?.` distinguish "no value" from "not permitted".
 *
 * Pricing lives on the server and only on the server. The client used to
 * compute fares from coordinates; it now asks and is told. A price the browser
 * computes is a price the browser can change.
