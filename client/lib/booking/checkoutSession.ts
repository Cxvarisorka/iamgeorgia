 * nightly breakdown, the cancellation terms — travels in `sessionStorage`
 * beside it, because an offer token runs to a few thousand characters and has
 * no business in a URL.
 *
 * `sessionStorage` rather than `localStorage` deliberately: a checkout is one
 * tab's business, and two tabs booking two different rooms must not overwrite
 * each other's summary. Losing it is survivable — the confirm call needs only
 * the hold token, so a draft that has gone shows a reduced summary rather than
 * an error.
 *
 * One store per product. A hotel draft and a tour draft are different shapes
 * under different keys, so a traveller with a hotel checkout open in one tab
 * and a tour in another loses neither.
