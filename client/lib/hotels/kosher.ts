 * badge that says "certified" in one place and something else in another is
 * worse than no badge at all.
 *
 * The rule that matters: **"certified" is rendered only from `certified`**,
 * which the server derives from a verified, unexpired, property-scoped
 * certificate. Nothing here re-derives it from a date, and nothing here infers
 * it from a feature list. A property with every kosher facility ticked and no
 * certificate reads "Kosher services · not certified", which is the truth.
