 * Admin navigation.

 * Four levels, and each one earns its place. **Groups** split the operator's
 * day into things that need a decision (bookings, partner applications) and
 * things that are catalogue maintenance. **Sections** collect the screens of a
 * single vertical that is too big to sit flat — transfers alone owns eight
 * screens, and left unnested they crowded out every other kind of inventory
 * in the sidebar. **Sub-groups** split a long section along a line the reader
 * already knows (the catalogue versus the fleet), each run captioned and set
 * off by a divider so eight rows read as two short lists rather than one long
 * one. **Items** are the screens themselves.
 *
 * A vertical stays flat until it has more than one catalogue screen: hotels,
 * destinations and tours each have exactly one way in, and wrapping a single
 * link in a disclosure would be a control that hides one thing.
