 * The public site is deliberately *not* session-aware on the server: calling
 * `cookies()` in the site layout would make every marketing page dynamic, and
 * the home page is currently static. So the one place the site needs to know
 * who is signed in — the link into the staff surfaces — asks after hydration
 * instead, and renders a sensible signed-out default until the answer arrives.
 *
 * The promise is cached at module scope, so a page with several consumers, and
 * a client-side navigation between pages, all share one request. It is
 * deliberately not persisted: a stale "you are signed in" surviving a sign-out
 * in another tab would be worse than a request.
